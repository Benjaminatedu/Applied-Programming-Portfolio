# Overview

The helloworld.py file contains a single line of code. This line of code prints the phrase "hello world!" to the console window of your terminal.

The purpose of creating this software is to illustrate that I can properly use Github, Git, VS Code, and Python. It also proves that I am capable of creating a comprehensive portfolio for a piece of software.

# Development Environment

The tools I used to develop this software are as follows:
- GitHub: Github is where I have published my software and ReadMe.MD file.
- VS Code: VS Code is the text editor that I used to write my software.
- Git: Git is what I used to commit and push my changes from VS Code to GitHub.
